# TASK A

# TASK B
## Only A vs A,B,C
A alone had lower max time than any of A,B,C in the joint test.
The variance of A alone was also significantly lower than any of A,B,C in the joint test.

In the joint test, the variance of A was approx 3 times the variance of A alone.
The max value of A alone was lower, but the change was not so significant as with the variance.

## Lowest variance
A has lowest variance
## Lowest max
C has the lowest max

## A,B and C equal?
They are quite similar.

# TASK C

The test with interrupt provided signifcant better results, with variance around 0.2-0.3 us, and worst max times approximately halved.
A behaves better than B which again behaves better than C.

# TASK D

## Deferred technique
The deferred technique is slower than immediate processing. That is because the program still has to wait for the while loop before any action is taken. \
The positive effect is that the program spends less time in the interrupt handler, so if the repsonse time is sufficient, it can be a good choice with the deferred technique.

## Expensive B

Expensive B had least effect on A with immediate processing, while it had least effect on C with deferred interrupt handling. We suspect this has to do with the order of the tests, \
and the fact that the interrupt handler for C cannot start before the interrupt handler for B is  finished. In deferred interrupt handling, the interrupt handler would be sooner ready to handle interrupt from C.
