## TASK A

### Without disturbances
Normal good performance
### With disturbances
Not much change from without disturbances.

## TASK B

Last time the worst case of the periodic pthread threads weren't very predictable, \
but now with Xenomai tasks, the worst-case seems to be quite consistent just above 1000 us.
The disturbances do not really affect the runtime as they are running on the secondary mode.
